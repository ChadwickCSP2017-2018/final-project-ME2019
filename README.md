# City Scroller Assignment
In order to ease the development process you will want to install [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify#usage)

Run this command in Terminal to install

`apm install atom-beautify`

You'll also need to create a cityScroller.pde. In your directory run this command

`ln cityScroller.js cityScroller.pde`

This will create a Processing file that is linked to your javascript file. Any changes you make to your javascript file will also be made to the Processing file. 

**ONLY MAKE CHANGES TO cityScroller.js**
